# MapWizard
MapWizard software consists of a set of tools to perform an assessment of undiscovered mineral resources. The user interface displays the tools in an intuitive order to support the flow of the assessment process. 

# Installation and requirements
The installation package can be found in https://github.com/gtkfi/MapWizard/releases. The package contains detailed installation instructions and a link to an additional test data package. Beta versions from 1.0.7 onwards also contain R-3.6.3 bundled in the root directory of the installed software.

# Development environment
If you want to debug MapWizard in Visual Studio, copy the R-3.6.3 folder to MapWizard/bin/debug/scripts/ . This is because the contents of the R folder are not copied to the output directory by default.
