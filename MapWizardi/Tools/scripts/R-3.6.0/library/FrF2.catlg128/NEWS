Changes to package FrF2.catlg128

Version 1.2-1, 19/04/2013
    made the dominating element of the catalogues informative, 
    instead of including the element "TRUE" for all designs 

Version 1.2, 18/04/2013
    added designs from 25 to 33 factors (only the even/odd designs, 
    i.e. omitting those without odd words)
    
    The catalogues are now lazy-loaded and provided in one 
    sysdata.rda file in the R directory, 
    rather than as separate data files in the data directory. 
    Thus, the install size of the package has been vastly reduced.
    As a consequence, the data() command for loading the catalogues
    is no longer needed and does even yield an error message.

    Removed file LICENSE in order to get rid of R CMD check note.

    Updated maintainer e-mail address
    

Version 1.1, 29/06/2012
    considerably reduced the number of designs included:
    excluded all even resolution IV designs (i.e. all those 
    without odd words, picked based on those without words of 
    length 5)

Version 1.0-3, 29/06/2012
    added a namespace (never went to CRAN, 
    was created for download from homepage)

Version 1.0-2, 04/02/2011
    eliminated .Random.seed and .required from each of the rda files

Version 1.0-1, 03/02/2011
    removed zipdata = yes, 
    modified rda files to smaller sizes with tools::resaveRdaFiles
    and added the file for 24 factors to the package

First version on CRAN: 
    Version 1.0, 23/04/2010
